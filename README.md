## What is Thin Chess?

Thin Chess is a collection of chess variants played on extremely narrow boards (1-3 files). By stripping away the complexity of the full 8√ó8 board, these variants help you:

- **Master fundamental tactics** - Forks, pins, and skewers in simplified positions
- **Learn endgame technique** - King and rook mates, opposition, tempo play
- **Build pattern recognition** - Core chess principles without overwhelming complexity
- **Train calculation** - See deeper with fewer pieces and squares

### Current Game Modes

**1-D Chess** (2 modes)
- Single-file line chess with Kings, Rooks, and Knights
- Perfect-play solver provides instant evaluations
- Includes classic 12-square variant and compact 8-square "Monk" variant

**Classic Technique** (3 modes)
- Essential endgame patterns on 2√ó5, 2√ó6, and 3√ó5 boards
- K+R vs K ladder mate, K+Q vs K technique, K+B+N mate finish
- Progressive hint system with full solutions

## Position Codes

Share and save positions using compact text notation.

**1-D Chess (8 squares):**
```
bk,br,bn,x,x,wn,wr,wk:w
```

**1-D Chess (12 squares):**
```
bk,br,bn,br,bn,x,x,wn,wr,wn,wr,wk:w
```

**Thin Chess (2√ó6 board):**
```
x,bk/x,x/x,x/wk,x/wr,x/x,x:w
```

**Format Guide:**
- Pieces: `wk` (white king), `br` (black rook), `wn` (white knight), etc.
- `x` = empty square
- Turn indicator: `:w` (white to move) or `:b` (black to move)
- **1-D Chess:** Comma-separated from top to bottom
- **Thin Chess:** Ranks separated by `/`, cells within ranks separated by `,`

## Learning Tips

### For 1-D Chess:
- **Use the solver** to check your intuition after thinking
- **Study "DRAW" positions** - these are perfectly balanced
- **Knights are powerful** - they can jump over traffic
- **Rooks need open lines** - avoid blocking them with your own pieces
- **King safety matters** - don't walk into checks

### For Classic Technique:
- **Read the hints before playing** - understand the goal first
- **Practice the pattern multiple times** - muscle memory matters
- **Compare to full-board versions** - principles transfer to 8√ó8 chess
- **Focus on opponent's king** - restrict it first, mate second
- **Watch for stalemate** - especially in K+Q vs K

## Technical Details

**Architecture:**
- **Engine:** Pure TypeScript, zero runtime dependencies
- **1-D Chess Solver:** Tri-valued negamax with transposition table and repetition detection
- **Thin Chess AI:** Random legal move selection (positions too complex for perfect play)

- **Testing:** Vitest with comprehensive edge case coverage
- **Configuration:** JSON-based game mode system - add new modes without code changes

**Performance:**
- Solver evaluates 1-D Chess positions instantly (< 10ms typical)
- Transposition table caches results for repeated positions
- Responsive on all devices from phones to desktops

**Browser Support:**
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge 90+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 88+
- ‚úÖ Safari 14+

## Adding Custom Game Modes

Thin Chess uses a JSON configuration system. You can add new modes without writing code!

See [ADDING_MODES.md](ADDING_MODES.md) for the complete guide.

**Quick example:**
```json
{
  "id": "MY_NEW_MODE",
  "categoryId": "1d-chess",
  "name": "My Custom Mode",
  "variant": "1xN",
  "boardWidth": 1,
  "boardHeight": 10,
  "startPosition": "bk,br,bn,x,x,x,x,wn,wr,wk:w",
  "difficulty": "Intermediate",
  "difficultyStars": 3,
  "icon": "üéØ"
}
```
