## General Strategy Tips

### For 1-D Chess (1×N boards):
- **Knights** jump ±2 squares (cannot attack adjacent squares)
- **Rooks** slide any distance (can be blocked)
- **Kings** move ±1 square
- Central control is critical
- Piece coordination essential in limited space
- First-move advantage significant in symmetric positions

### For Thin Chess (2-3 file boards):
- **Fork potential** is high due to narrow width
- **Bishop color-complex** strategy is amplified
- **Rook control** of central ranks is powerful
- **Knight mobility** between files creates tactical opportunities
- Every piece move has immediate tactical implications

### For Three-File Modes (3×6, 3×8):
- **Queen diagonals** unlock new tactical patterns
- **More escape routes** for both sides
- **Multi-piece coordination** becomes more complex
- **Diagonal pins and skewers** are more effective
- Balance queen power with defensive king safety
