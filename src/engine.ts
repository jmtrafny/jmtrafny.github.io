    challenge: 'An asymmetric 1D battle on a 7-square board where White has two knights versus Black\'s single rook (each side has a king as well). The imbalance forces creative play. White\'s goal is to use the two knights in tandem to trap and checkmate Black\'s king or to capture the rook, while Black\'s rook will try to pick off the knights and avoid getting cornered. The black king starts behind the rook (at the far end), ensuring the rook isn\'t initially blocked.',

      'This mode plays out as a tense cat-and-mouse game. White\'s knights have strength in numbers and agility, able to threaten from different distances, while Black\'s rook has superior range and can strike from afar.',
      'Every move counts: if the knights coordinate, they can corner the rook or king; if they split up or miscalculate, the rook will systematically eliminate them. The asymmetry makes the scenario unpredictable and highly replayable.',

    solution: 'This is a balanced handicap match testing your ability to leverage mobility vs. power.\n\nWhite Strategy: Advance knights together, coordinating to create fork opportunities and trap the rook. Use one knight to restrict while the other attacks.\n\nBlack Strategy: Keep rook active. Use range to pick off exposed knights. Maintain king safety by keeping rook between king and enemy knights.\n\nKey Concepts: Material imbalance, two-piece coordination, long-range vs short-range tactics.',
