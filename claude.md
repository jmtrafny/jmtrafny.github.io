# Claude Agent Instructions

## Development Server

**DO NOT run `npm run dev`** - The development server should not be started by agents. The user will run it manually when needed.

For testing and validation:
- Use `npm run build` to check for TypeScript errors and ensure the build succeeds
- The user will manually start the dev server when they want to test the application
